	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Use \verb|\colon| instead of \verb|:| for defining functions.
		\item Leave space around most operators.
		For example, \verb|f \colon X \to Y| is superior to \verb|f:X\to Y|.
		Possible exception are guided by readability, for example:
		
		\verb|\begin{equation*}| \\
		\verb|\sum_{i=1}^n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}| \\
		\verb|\end{equation*}|
		
		\item No punctuation inside math mode: \verb|$a+b$,| instead of \verb|$a+b,$|.
		\item No line breaks in the middle of sentences.
		\item Use line breaks at the end of sentences.
		\item No double blank spaces.
		\item No blank spaces at the end of sentences.
		\item All environments with the exception of \verb|document| and those in the AMS display equation family, e.g., \verb|equation| or \verb|align| should be tabbed.
		For example,
		
		\verb|\begin{lemma*}| \\
		\verb|    Statement.| \\
		\verb|\end{lemma*}|
		
		\item Do not use \verb|$$...$$| for display equation, instead use one of the environments in the AMS display equation family or
		
		\verb|\[| \\
		\verb|...| \\
		\verb|\]|
		
		\item Leave a blank line before and after tabbed environment, i.e., all environments except those in the AMS display equation family.
		\item Leave a blank line before and after sections and subsections.
